## Project Description

This Flutter app leverages the Google Books API to provide users with a rich reading experience. Users can preview books, search for their favorite titles, and discover similar books based on their interests.

### Key Features

- **Book Preview**: Users can preview books directly within the app, allowing them to get a glimpse of the content before making a decision.
- **Search Functionality**: The app enables users to search for their favorite books, making it easy to find and explore a wide range of titles.
- **Discover Similar Books**: By analyzing user preferences, the app suggests similar books, helping users discover new reads.
- **Introduction Screen:** A welcoming introduction screen to guide users. It is shown only once using SharedPreferences.
- **Dynamic Home Page**: The home page of the app makes two API requests to ensure that users have access to the latest and most relevant content.
- **Categories in Search Page**: Users can now browse books by categories, enhancing the search experience and making it easier to find relevant content.
- **Refresh Indicator**: Added a refresh indicator to the home page, allowing users to manually refresh the content for the latest updates.
 
### Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The app is built using the Flutter framework, allowing for a smooth and responsive user interface across different platforms.
- **Google Books API**: The app integrates with the Google Books API to fetch book information and enable preview functionality.
- **API Requests**: The app makes use of asynchronous programming to handle multiple API requests, ensuring a seamless user experience.
